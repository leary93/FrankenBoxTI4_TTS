# FrankenBoxTI4_TTS
Working Repository for the Updated Franken Box - building on the box that already existed

# Franken Box with Cool Script 

These are the json and png file as needed to upload in the saved objects folder of TTS

# Franken Setup Menu 

This is the script for the Franken Setup Menu object (which automatically pops out of the box)

# Setup a Franken game mixing box .... 

This is the script attached to the Franken Box itself. 

# How to update the scripts: 

1. Load TTS TI4 mod
2. Pull out the Franken Box from your saved objects
3. Save gamestate (because you can't overwrite scripting if you aren't in a personal savestate)
4. Load saved gamestate 
5. Open the scripting of either the Franken Box or the setup menu
6. Select all and Copy the updated script into it. 
7. Press Save and Play (this will save over the gamestate you loaded up)
8. Put Franken Menu back in the box and Save Object
9. You can now commit the updated object .json
